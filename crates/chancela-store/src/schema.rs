//! SQLite schema for the durable system of record (t30.md §2, "Tables").
//!
//! The DDL is expressed as idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` / `CREATE INDEX IF NOT
//! EXISTS` statements so [`crate::Store::open`] can run it on every boot — a fresh database is
//! created and an existing one is left untouched. Real schema migrations (when the layout ever
//! changes) key off the `schema_version` row in `meta`.
//!
//! ## Model (t30.md §D2)
//!
//! Aggregates are stored **document-in-relational**: `(id, …scope cols…, json)` where `json` is
//! the serde serialization of the domain value. This keeps "relational" honest (real tables,
//! transactions, indices for scoped retrieval) while avoiding a brittle per-field column schema
//! that the fast-evolving ENT/LEG domain would force constant migrations on. The `events` table
//! stores the hash-chain fields directly so a per-`scope` / per-`kind` retrieval is indexed and
//! the chain order (`seq`) is the primary key (ARC-14 append-only event table).

/// The schema version recorded in `meta` and asserted by [`crate::Store::open`].
///
/// Bump this only alongside a real migration step.
/// - **v1** — the initial durable layout (meta/events/entities/books/acts/registry_extracts).
/// - **v2** — adds the `documents` table (Wave C, t48-e4): generated PDF/A documents preserved
///   alongside their sealed act (plan t48 §3.3/§3.4/D4). Forward-only: an existing v1 database
///   gains the table via the idempotent [`ALL`] DDL and has its stamp advanced on next open.
/// - **v3** — adds the `imported_books` isolation namespace (t54-E2): per-book bundle imports are
///   held here (verdict + provenance + the retained, read-only bundle bytes) so a foreign book
///   chain is **never merged into the live global spine** (which would require re-hashing and
///   destroy tamper-evidence). Forward-only, additive: existing databases gain the table via [`ALL`].
/// - **v4** — adds the qualified-signing tables (t57-S3): `signed_documents` preserves the SIGNED
///   PDF variant + signature metadata for an act's sealed document (alongside the unsigned
///   `documents` row), and `pending_cmd_sessions` holds an in-flight two-phase Chave Móvel Digital
///   signing session (the non-secret `CmdSignSession` + `PreparedSignature` serde blobs) across the
///   `initiate`→`confirm` request pair. **Neither table ever stores a PIN or an OTP.** Forward-only,
///   additive: existing databases gain the tables via [`ALL`] and advance their stamp on next open.
