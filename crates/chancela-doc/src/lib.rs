//! # chancela-doc — the PDF/A-2u writer (t48 / DOC-01, Wave C batch-0)
//!
//! Skeleton published by **t48-e0**. This crate consumes the frozen
//! [`chancela_core::DocumentModel`] seam (§3.1) and writes **PDF/A-2u** bytes directly over
//! `lopdf` — owning text layout, pagination, font embedding, the sRGB OutputIntent, the XMP
//! metadata packet (`pdfaid:part=2` / `pdfaid:conformance=U`), and structural self-verification.
//!
//! **Why lopdf-direct (D2):** it guarantees the byte-shape `chancela-pades::sign_pdf` requires —
//! a **classic cross-reference table (not an xref stream)**, no AcroForm, inline first-page
//! `/Annots` — *by construction*, because we write every object. That constraint is the whole
//! reason a purpose-built writer wins over typst/printpdf. e3 proves it with a generate→sign
//! round-trip.
//!
//! **Implemented by t48-e2 / e2a.** The writer lowers the model through a bounded layout engine
//! (`layout`), embeds the bundled Noto Serif face (`font`, `assets/fonts/`) as a Type0 / Identity-H
//! font with a `/ToUnicode` CMap, attaches the sRGB OutputIntent (`assets/icc/`) and the XMP
//! metadata packet (`xmp`), forces a classic cross-reference table, and structurally self-verifies
//! (`selfcheck`) — all deterministically (no clock/RNG), so the same model reproduces identical
//! bytes and a stable `pdf_digest`. The writer also exposes an accessibility report (`pdfa`) and
//! emits a full tagged-PDF structure. When a document conforms (no PDF/UA blockers, determinable
//! metadata) the writer **claims PDF/UA-1** (ISO 14289-1): it stamps `pdfuaid:part=1` + a
//! `pdfaExtension` schema in the XMP and `selfcheck` enforces the UA invariants as a gate. The
//! claim is scoped to the **pre-signature** document; the signature `chancela-pades` later injects
//! is out of the UA claim. A non-conforming document stays a valid PDF/A-2U file with no UA claim.
